## All sorts of fuckers
###### Aug 04, 2020

So I've met a whole bunch of fine and smart developers.
Most of them are super ambitious but sometimes it happens that their ambition is focused completely wrong.
Here are some of those exceptional examples.

For example there is a **"visibility addict"**. This motherfucker will stick his head into every single issue that in any way relates to talking with other teams or external stakeholders. It is so perfectly clear that this guy does not give a flying fuck about doing externally "invisible" work and only digs for tasks that can put him on the company radar somehow.
Terrible fucking guy to work with, you will feel his elbowing every time team needs to communicate with the outside world. Also, he will be sounding his horn and bragging on company chats for every single fucking accomplishment he does. This guy is ambitious but his ambition is limited to the nearest company stakeholders. He does not have higher ambitions than that and his serotonine levels are highly corelated with the number of times his name is mentioned in Slack.

Then there is the **"no risk guy"**.
This is the motherfucker that will avoid aaany fucking task that involves risking his reputation or sticking his neck towards stakeholders in any way.
So if we would put all tasks on the "reputation risk" axis, this guy will scratch and dig with all his might for those tasks closest to the zero point on the axis.
For example there are initiatives where many stakeholders are waiting for delivery, many people will give you feedback for it, and chances are you will not get it right the first time and you will need to iterate. Usually new features or big feature epics. This guy will avoid this kind of potential rep risks and try not to involve himself in leading such initiatives. On the other hand he will comfortably enjoy coming up with "no rep risk" tasks. These are the tings for which there is no fucking way in the world you can fuck up. You can only gain some rep. So this guy will come up with lots of improvements, like improving logging, observability, drawing diagrams, facilitating sessions about which he heard about in most recent software blogs and so on. While no one could argue that these are not fine and great improvements, on their own none of these will bring direct value to your customers and put bread on the table. But for this guy this is perfectly fine, his ambition ends far before reaching any business goals or customers. He does not give a shit about the business or the product he is building (if building it at all, because actually building stuff is risky), he just wants to score some rep with no risk and elevate further on the company ladder.

Also we have a **"fancy tech stack hunter"**.
This guy's primary ambition is to fill up his juicy curriculum vitae with all the new fancy technologies, frameworks and databases that he can get his hands on. He will hunt for new opportunities to add some work experience on the latest tech stack in the company so that he can proudly stick it in his resume. Usually this guy will waste your time by being very opinionated in pushing to use his preferred techs in situations where the choice actually does not matter that much and he just wants to use "his" because it is fancier. His ambition rests on curating his CV every weekend while drinking coffee and eating bagels.

And finally there is the famous **"ivory tower architect, decider of everything, master-fucking-mind guy"**.
There are many articles about this guy since industry kind of noticed already that he is fucking deprecated and probably there is not much more to say about him. Like others, he is also very ambitious and his ambition rests mainly on keeping the position of the smartest person in the room and never allowing other low level peasant developers to appear smarter than he does. Now this involves quite a few advanced techniques. Such as selling complexity by fogging everyone's sight with making things appear more complex than they actually are. Since this guy is in an ivory tower and you can not really get down to often from a high tower to code with your code monkeys, he just comes down from time to time, sells some complex gibberish story, makes a fucking whiteboard drawing where tree boxes and a cylinder are talking with each other and codes some fucking useless proof of concept that does not prove shit. Then he drops his ivory mic, goes back and climbs his tower and leaves rest of you fuckers to finish up "implementation details" of his brilliant vision of three boxes and a cylinder. This motherfucker is the most dangerous of all, since he can actually decide all the things but his ambitions do not reach far beyond keeping his precious ivory tower to himself.

Know ambitions of people in your company, make sure that there are at least some whose main goal is to build awesome software products for your customers and provide right incentives to support those fuckers in their ambitions.

## Proactive and reactive QA
###### July 25, 2020

I have been working in software industry for almost a decade now and during that time I worked with many QA engineers. There are many different QAs out there and I will describe characteristics of some that I encountered.

On my first job I had a colleague that was, what I would call, a "ninja QA". This guy was a QA with super strong tech knowledge, he actually knew how to write software and was even better at it than quite some of the devs we had.

He was writing proof of concept for new frameworks, presenting them to the rest of the company and holding tech talks every now and then. This is the guy that will try very hard to automate most of the QA work and avoid manual testing at all costs. The thing with this guy was that you could clearly see he was not happy with his QA role, he was more focusing on getting closer to development than taking care of the product quality. And this is perfectly fine. Although most of the time the guy looked grumpy and somehow frustrated.

Another type of QA that I encountered is a "proactive manual tester". QA colleagues I worked with that fall under this category are usually friendly laid back bunch that you can work with quite well. There were quite some QAs of this type, and this is the category that I encountered most often. Usually these QAs are good team players and you can rely on them for testing your features in detail. They will click through the product as user would and they will find quite some of your bugs during the process. I found these QAs great to work with, and also quite useful for finding holes in the quality of your delivery. These guys are testing your code thoroughly before prod, trying to find bugs and give fast feedback, thus the "proactive" nickname.

Last but not the least, are "reactive testers". I must say this is the type I got quite angry with few times. These guys are usually not laid back, like most of proactive testers. In my experience they were quite invested in the company, but unfortunatelly not in the actual testing process but perhaps chasing some different personal agenda. The nickname "reactive" comes from the fact that these QAs do not test much prior to prod. They come to you after patiently waiting that you deliver your code to prod, with issues and bugs that they have found. Usually these findings come from someone from other team complaining about something or customer support getting tickets from end users. From all the QA types this type is most concerned about counting the actual number of bugs that they have found. They see bug count as a metric for the success of their work. Which is quite opposite of the "proactive" QA that with his work prevents bugs from being created in the first place.

So metrics by which QAs measure success of their work differ from type to type.
