## Profits & engineers
###### Feb 23, 2021

It is that time of the year when, after you've been busting your programmer ass whole year, the time has come to talk about raise and promotions. First you need to complete your end of the year review, and finish all the fucking nonsense "SMART" goals that your manager had forced you to come up with, since he has no fucking idea what kind of engineer you are or how the fuck you are contributing to the company.

You are having talks with this guy every now and then, he asks you how you are doing and you are chatting away answering his repetitive questions. You do not have any agenda, you are just keeping him up to date. Then after some time passes and as you realize that your manager is not mentioning promotions or raises or anything of that sort, you start figuring out that you've been doing this wrong the whole time. While you've been casually chatting with this fucker, you were supposed to self promote, gloat about your achievements and put yourself on a pedestal continuously during these chats to imprint your superior vision of your profesional persona in your manager's mind. For some reason you had this wrong assumption that among engineers and analytical thinkers this is not needed, and that credits and recognitions will just come with results. But, you soon realize, the assumption was wrong and, as the rest of the homo sapiens species, primates in software engineering world are also keen on judging the monkey by the loudness of his chest beating. And you also realize that your engineering value that you are delivering to the company, which can be best understood by other engineers, is not being evaluated by them, but by managers who can not have a good idea on how much each engineer contributes.

So then you take your keyboard and start recollecting all the projects you have completed, all the designs you contributed to and all the damn lines of beatifully clean and neat code you wrote. You summarize all that in a nice email and press "Send" and the chest beating is on its way to a monkey which is higher in the hierarchy of software monkeys than you are. Your manager reads it, raises his eyebrow as he notices that you might not be that useless that he thought and finally starts talking about promotion and raise and for a moment you feel as if all your hard work is recognized.

Then, after serveral months, few broken promises about when you will get the actual promotion and a raise, and a lot of delaying due to late budgets, finally the day comes. Your manager tells you that you have been promoted! Wohooooo!
As he congratulates you he does not mention a word about a salary increase due to promotion.
You ask about it, and he starts talking about bad budget they got, how not everyone got promoted and so on...
So you finish the conversation with a sour smile on your face, you look at that fucking list of achievements and you start adding it to your CV since obviously you will need to find another corporation to slave for.

Note to self:
 * profits are not shared fairly with engineers and
 * profits are not shared fairly among engineers.


## All sorts of fuckers
###### Aug 04, 2020

So I've met a whole bunch of fine and smart developers.
Most of them are super ambitious but sometimes it happens that their ambition is focused completely wrong.
Here are some of those exceptional examples.

For example there is a **"visibility addict"**.
This motherfucker will stick his head into every single issue that in any way relates to talking with other teams or external stakeholders. It is so perfectly clear that this guy does not give a flying fuck about doing externally "invisible" work and only digs for tasks that can put him on the company radar somehow.
Terrible fucking guy to work with, you will feel his elbowing every time team needs to communicate with the outside world. Also, he will be sounding his horn and bragging on company chats for every single fucking accomplishment he does.

<img

	style="display: block; margin-left :auto; margin-right: auto; box-shadow: none;"/>

This guy is ambitious but his ambition is limited to the nearest company stakeholders. His ambition does not extend much further from serotonine boosts he gets when his name gets mentioned in Slack.

Then there is the **"no risk guy"**.
This is the motherfucker that will avoid aaany fucking task that involves risking his reputation or sticking his neck towards stakeholders in any way. So if we would put all tasks on the "reputation risk" axis, this guy will scratch and dig with all his might for those tasks closest to the zero point on the axis.

<img
	src="no_risk_fucker.svg"
	style="display: block; margin-left :auto; margin-right: auto; box-shadow: none;"/>

For example there are initiatives where many stakeholders are waiting for delivery, many people will give you feedback for it, and chances are you will not get it right the first time and you will need to iterate. Usually new features or big feature epics. This guy will avoid this kind of potential rep risks, delegate and look for scape goats and try not to involve himself in leading such initiatives. On the other hand he will comfortably enjoy coming up with "no rep risk" tasks. These are the things for which there is no fucking way in the world you can fuck up. You can only gain some rep. So this guy will come up with lots of improvements, like improving logging, observability, drawing diagrams, facilitating sessions about which he heard about in most recent software blogs and so on. While no one could argue that these are not fine and great improvements, on their own none of these will bring direct value to your customers and put bread on the table. But for this guy this is perfectly fine, his ambition ends far before reaching any business goals or customers. He does not give a shit about the business or the product he is building (if building it at all, because actually building stuff is risky), he just wants to score some rep with no risk and elevate further on the company ladder.

Also we have a **"fancy tech stack hunter"**.
This guy's primary ambition is to fill up his juicy curriculum vitae with all the new fancy technologies, frameworks and databases that he can get his hands on.
He will hunt for new opportunities to add some work experience on the latest tech stack in the company so that he can proudly stick it in his resume. Usually this guy will waste your time by being very opinionated in pushing to use his preferred techs in situations where the choice actually does not matter that much and he just wants to use "his" because it is fancier. His ambition rests on curating his CV endlesly every weekend while drinking coffee and eating bagels.

<img
	src="cv_curator.svg"
	style="display: block; margin-left :auto; margin-right: auto; box-shadow: none;"/>

And finally there is the famous **"ivory tower architect, decider of everything, master-fucking-mind guy"**.
There are many articles about this guy since industry kind of noticed already that he is fucking deprecated and probably there is not much more to say about him.

<img
	src="ivory_tower.svg"
	style="display: block; margin-left :auto; margin-right: auto; box-shadow: none;"/>

Like others, he is also very ambitious and his ambition rests mainly on keeping the position of the smartest person in the room and never allowing other low level peasant developers to appear smarter than he does. Now this involves quite a few advanced techniques. Such as selling complexity by fogging everyone's sight with making things appear more complex than they actually are. Since this guy is in an ivory tower and you can not really get down to often from a high tower to code with your code monkeys, he just comes down from time to time, sells some complex gibberish story, makes a fucking whiteboard drawing where tree boxes and a cylinder are talking with each other and codes some fucking useless proof of concept that does not prove shit. Then he drops his ivory mic, goes and climbs back to his tower and leaves rest of you fuckers to finish up "implementation details" of his brilliant vision of three boxes and a cylinder. This motherfucker is the most dangerous of all, since he can actually decide all the things but his ambitions do not reach far beyond keeping his precious ivory tower to himself.

Know ambitions of people in your company, make sure that there are at least some whose main goal is to build awesome software products for your customers and provide right incentives to support those fuckers in their ambitions.

## Proactive and reactive QA
###### July 25, 2020

Bit of a rant about our brothers in arms - QAs. 
There are quite some different QAs out there and I will describe characteristics of some that I encountered.

On my first job I had a colleague that was, what I would call, a "ninja QA". This guy was a QA with super strong tech knowledge, he actually knew how to write software and was even better at it than a lot of the devs we had.
He was writing proof of concept for new frameworks, presenting them to the rest of the company and holding tech talks every now and then. This is the guy that will try very hard to automate most of the QA work and avoid manual testing at all costs. The thing with this guy was that you could clearly see he was not happy with his QA role, he was more focusing on getting closer to development than taking care of the product quality. And this is perfectly fine. Although most of the time the guy looked grumpy and somehow frustrated.

Another type of QA that I encountered is a "proactive manual tester". QA colleagues I worked with that fall under this category are usually friendly laid back bunch that you can work with quite well. There were quite some QAs of this type, and this is the category that I encountered most often. Usually these QAs are good team players and you can rely on them for testing your features in detail. They will click through the product as user would and they will find quite some of your bugs during the process. I found these QAs great to work with, and also quite useful for finding holes in the quality of your delivery. These guys are testing your code thoroughly before prod, trying to find bugs and give fast feedback, thus the "proactive" nickname.

Last but not the least, are "reactive testers". These are the fuckers that can get you quite frustrated. These guys are usually not laid back, like most of proactive testers. In my experience they were quite invested in the company, but unfortunatelly not in the actual testing process but perhaps chasing some different personal agenda. The nickname "reactive" comes from the fact that these QAs do not test much prior to prod. They come to you after patiently waiting that you deliver your code to prod, with issues and bugs that they have found. Usually these findings come from someone from other team complaining about something or customer support getting tickets from end users. From all the QA types this type is most concerned about counting the actual number of bugs that they have found. They see prod bug count as a metric for the success of their work. Which is quite opposite of the "proactive" QA that with his work prevents prod bugs from being created in the first place.
